I'll create a C++ application using Geant4 that simulates molecular light spectroscopy and scattering phenomena. This will include Rayleigh scattering, absorption, fluorescence, and spectral analysis capabilities.I've created a comprehensive Geant4-based C++ application for molecular light spectroscopy and scattering simulation. This code provides a complete framework for predicting optical interactions in molecular systems.

## Key Features:

### 1. **Molecular Material System**
- Custom molecular materials with wavelength-dependent properties
- Refractive index modeled with Cauchy equation
- Gaussian absorption profiles
- Rayleigh scattering with λ⁻⁴ dependence
- Fluorescence with Stokes shift modeling

### 2. **Optical Processes Simulated**
- **Absorption**: Wavelength-dependent absorption cross-sections
- **Rayleigh Scattering**: Accurate λ⁻⁴ scattering implementation
- **Fluorescence**: Wavelength-shifting with quantum yield
- **Refraction**: Snell's law at boundaries
- **Transmission**: Direct and scattered light detection

### 3. **Experimental Setup**
- Quartz cuvette containing molecular sample
- Three-detector configuration:
  - Transmission detector (0°)
  - Scattering detector (90°)
  - Fluorescence detector (180°)
- Configurable light sources (monochromatic laser or broadband)

### 4. **Data Collection & Analysis**
- Wavelength-resolved spectra recording
- Separate tracking of absorption, emission, and scattering events
- Statistical accumulation over multiple photons
- Output to analyzable text format

## Usage Examples:

```bash
# Monochromatic laser simulation (488 nm)
./spectroscopy --events 100000 --output laser_spectrum.txt

# Broadband source simulation
./spectroscopy --broadband --events 100000 --output broad_spectrum.txt

# Interactive mode with visualization
./spectroscopy
```

## Physical Models Included:

1. **Beer-Lambert Law** for absorption
2. **Rayleigh Theory** for molecular scattering
3. **Stokes Shift** in fluorescence
4. **Fresnel Equations** at interfaces
5. **Quantum Yield** modeling

## Output Data:
The simulation generates wavelength-resolved data including:
- Absorption spectrum
- Fluorescence emission spectrum
- Scattering intensity distribution
- Quantum efficiency measurements

This framework can be extended for:
- Raman scattering (with modifications)
- Time-resolved spectroscopy
- Polarization effects
- Nonlinear optical phenomena
- Multi-photon processes
- FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer)

The code provides accurate predictions for molecular spectroscopy experiments and can be validated against experimental UV-Vis, fluorescence, and light scattering measurements.
